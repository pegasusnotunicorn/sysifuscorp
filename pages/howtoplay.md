The objective of the game is to race around the 5x5 board by building a path to each of the corners. All while backstabbing your fellow players by manipulating the tiles laid out in strategic ways.

It's quite literally _"rat-race, the board game."_

You can teach the game in about 5 minutes and in a few rounds, everybody will have understood all of the mechanics. Very easy to learn but hard to master.
