Hello! My name is [Wonmin][wonmin-website] (pronounced like 1 minute). I am based in NYC and am currently 27 years old. My duties include:

* designing the game mechanics
* writing blog posts
* and a billion other odd tasks


I am joined by my amazing designer friend, [Grace](https://www.midorikoa.com)! She is based in Boston and is currently 25 years old. Her duties include:

* making stuff look beautiful (not this blog)
* drawing graphics / pictures
* and another billion other odd tasks

**UPDATE** (2019/01/11) - [Grace has officially left](/2019/01/11/thank-you-and-good-bye-grace.html)! Thank you for all of your help!

This blog serves to document the process of creating a board game from scratch. A place to record all of the ups & downs, our innermost secrets or fears, and the blood / sweat / tears that go into creating a tangible product.

We'd like to thank you for visiting and welcome you along on our journey. We're not 100% sure how it'll turn out, but it's bound to be a fun adventure and hopefully we can create something amazing together.
