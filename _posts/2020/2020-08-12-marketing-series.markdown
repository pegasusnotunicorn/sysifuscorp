I've been trying to dabble in some basic marketing by doing some social media postings. Obviously I have no idea what I am doing but I figure having _something_ is better than nothing.

For the past few weeks, I've been doing daily posts, but for the next few weeks, I will be doing a deeper dive into the Office Politics cards and introduce each single one in a separate post. You can use the hashtag [#officepoliticsintro](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/officepoliticsintro/) to follow it!

Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sysifuscorp) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sysifuscorp/) for the latest posts! I am trying to post at least once per business day. I'm also pretty active on Reddit on the [/r/tabletopgaming subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TabletopGaming/).

Stay safe out there! Wouldn't want my precious employees getting sick.
