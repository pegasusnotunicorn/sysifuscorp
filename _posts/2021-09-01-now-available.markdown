It's been almost 3 whole years since [I started this website and blog](/2018/11/06/i-believe-introductions-are-in-order.html). And I cannot believe it took so long but we're finally here. You can now get your very own copy of _Welcome to Sysifus Corp_ by clicking the big shiny red button.

Here are some pictures from the factory where I packed them up to be shipped out.

Speaking of shipping, all the games for the Kickstarter backers who gave me their address should have been sent outâ€”both domestic and international backers! If you haven't filled out your address in Gamefound, then please check your email for a link or just email me for it if you lost it.

If you live in NYC, then message me and I will gladly hand deliver it to you personally :)
