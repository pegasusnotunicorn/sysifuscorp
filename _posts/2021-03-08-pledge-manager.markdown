Hello :)

By now all backers to my Kickstarter should have received an email from Gamefound, the company I am using to manage pledges. Please open the link, create an account, and select the items you purchased. You should already have a credit on your account for the amount you pledged on the Kickstarter campaign.

If you are not a backer and you discovered this campaign too late, don't worry! You can still do a late pledge [via Gamefound](https://gamefound.com/projects/pegasus-games/sysifuscorp#/) and still get your copy at the same time as everyone else.

Please [click here](https://gamefound.com/projects/pegasus-games/sysifuscorp#/) to go to the pledge manager.
