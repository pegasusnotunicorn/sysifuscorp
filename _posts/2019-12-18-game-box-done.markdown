The first sample run was a huge success. It feels so amazing to hold the (almost) final product in my hands.

I want to make a few more updates to the design before finalizing-

- Using a plastic handle instead of the cardboard one
- Making some of the text darker on the box
- Fixing the graphics on the rulebook front page
