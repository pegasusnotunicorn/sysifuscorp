I just want to take this moment to thank everyone who pledged in the campaign. I cannot wait until we get this bad boy manufactured and sent out.

Let me also update you on what I've been doing.

* From Feb 18 to 21 I will be attending TotalCon35 and will have my own little virtual vendor booth set up. If anyone here is attending, please do stop by and say hello!
* A few board game content creators just recently received a prototype version of my game so they are hard at work making cool preview / review videos for me. I'll post updates to these as they become available!

And once again, thank you so so so so so so much. Now that we're funded it's time to move onto the fun part.

Let me know in the comments below if you're as excited as my cat in the video ðŸ¤£
