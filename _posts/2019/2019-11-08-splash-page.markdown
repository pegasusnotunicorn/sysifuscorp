Here is a splash image that I am considering using for the game box cover / sleeve.

{% include image.html img-details=page.sysifus-splash %}

I am going for a neutral / bleak color scheme for the employees and the game in general. I used a lot of grays and blacks to convey my distaste for corporations and the #ratrace.

Meanwhile, the fictional company (Sysifus Corp) uses bright primary colors in all of their messaging. As if they are trying to instill positive energy from their ~~slaves~~ employees.

Please let me know what you think in the comments below! I also posted it on [/r/tabletopgamedesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/tabletopgamedesign/comments/dtnoh1/working_on_the_game_cover_not_really_sure_what/) so feel free to comment there as well!
