With bittersweet sadness and excitement, I wish to announce the departure of my dear friend and fellow designer, Grace.

Unfortunately, due to work and other mounting commitments, Grace was being pulled in a few too many directions at once. While I am sad at the departure of my co-designer, I am also filled with excitement to see what's in store for Grace in the year 2019!

Thank you so much for all of your help and hard work. Good luck in the coming year and I wish you the best.

For those of you who are interested in keeping up with her future projects, please do check out her personal website [here](https://www.midorikoa.com/).

I'd also like to send a personal shout-out to Nick for all of his help with brainstorming and having to deal with my constant visits to Boston. Thank you!
