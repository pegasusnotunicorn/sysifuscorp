Hello hello. Been a minute since I updated.

I just wanted to showcase another custom Office Politics card that I did for a backer friend of mine, Eunju.

{% include image.html img-details=page.custom-op-convo %}

And from that I was able to create this custom card for her!

And as always, thank you so much for all your support and comments. I will update again soon with more details on the manufacturing.

Please let me know in the comments what you think about Eunju's custom card. 😊
