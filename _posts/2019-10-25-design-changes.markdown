Here are some design changes that I've been working on. Please feel free to let me know what you think in the comments below!

{% include image.html img-details=page.sysifus-logo-flat %}

{% include image.html img-details=page.sysifus-logo-3d %}

You also might have noticed that the main page has been updated with some new illustrations.

I've been working with Adobe Illustrator this week and learning how to do 3D perspective drawing. So that was pretty cool. The illustrations are mostly edits of existing artwork for the [Office Politics Cards I mentioned last time](/2019/10/05/welcome-to-sysifus-corp.html)

Check it out below or on the [main page](/) of this website.

{% include image.html img-details=page.career-path %}

{% include image.html img-details=page.earn-influence %}

{% include image.html img-details=page.office-politics %}

This is a completely unrelated side note, but the OCD in me wonders if I should capitalize the first letter of each word in the blog post title...
