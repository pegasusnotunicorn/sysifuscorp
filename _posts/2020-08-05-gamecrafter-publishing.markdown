It's been a hot minute since I updated this blog...2020 has been a not so great year, but I am hoping to end it strong.

With that said, I am currently exploring other options at just getting this game published and available for purchase. [The Game Crafter](https://thegamecrafter.com) offers a neat way for small game developers like myself to [self-publish using their print-on-demand service](https://help.thegamecrafter.com/article/5-getting-started). This way, anyone can purchase a complete version of the game directly from The Game Crafter.

Here's a cool 3D box preview. Unfortunately, using a print-on-demand service means that I have to cut some of the cool custom designs I made. (Such as the suitcase handle on the top of the box). But hopefully there won't be much else I need to sacrifice to get this game out the door.
