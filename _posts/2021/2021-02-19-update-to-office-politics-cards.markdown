TGIF everyone!

Here's a quick update for you. I got some feedback from [the good folks on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/lgwfzi/5_years_ago_i_quit_my_corporate_job_2_years_ago_i/gmu4m6o/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that the text on my cards were hard to read. So I made the font a little bit bigger and I added an icon on the top left of the cards so that you can easily tell what type of cards you have when you have them fanned out in your hand.

Here are some example pictures.

{% include image.html img-details=page.new_office_politics_card %}

Here's the official change log.

* Font size increased for both the card text and the card title
* Added an icon on the top left to depict the type of Office Politics card it is
* Changed the layout of the artwork on some cards to accommodate the new icon
* Added extra line breaks and spacing for cards with fat paragraphs
* Changed the names of some cards
* Fixed artwork on some cards
* Fixed spacing on the text icons for some cards
