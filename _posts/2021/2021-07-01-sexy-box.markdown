Hello backers~ I've got some good news and some not so good news.

First the good news--

All boxes will have silver foil lettering and UV spot printing at no additional cost! You can see it clearly in this unboxing video teaser.

The games are all finished and have boarded on a ship to NY. They are scheduled to arrive by the end of July and hopefully I can ship them out to you in August.

Next, the not so good news--

There was a small manufacturing mistake with the cards and we will have to reprint them. My manufacturer has told me that they can get the fixed cards printed by mid July and get them shipped to me via airplane which hopefully means that they will arrive with the rest of the games by end of July.

That said, I will have to manually open all of the shrink wrap plastic packaging and replace the misprinted cards with the new ones for every single game (1000 copies) which might take a long time. I am still hopeful that I can get the games shipped out sometime in August as I originally stated.

Stay safe in the heat out there!
