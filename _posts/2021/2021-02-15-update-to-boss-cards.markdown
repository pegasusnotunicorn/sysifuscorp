Hey hey hey it's your favorite corporate employee back at it with a game update.

Thanks to [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/lgwfzi/5_years_ago_i_quit_my_corporate_job_2_years_ago_i/gmviavy/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I was inspired to make a second female version of the Bosses. All Boss cards will now be double sided and include a male and a female version. And I gave the male Bosses hair.
