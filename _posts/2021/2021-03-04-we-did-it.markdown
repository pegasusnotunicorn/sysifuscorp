Please keep an eye out in your inboxes for the link to the [pledge manager at Gamefound](https://gamefound.com/projects/pegasus-games/sysifuscorp#/). There you can sign up for an account and fill out your address details.

Here is the rough estimated timeline. I will update you as I learn more. Obviously everything is just a rough estimate and it'll probably change a lot as unforeseen events occur, but I appreciate your patience.

* March 4 - The Kickstarter ends
* March 18 - It takes 2 weeks to get the funding from the campaign
* End of March - All proofing done and production starts
* Early May - Production finished
* July - Production shipped to my warehouse in the US
* August - Games shipped to backers

Again. Thank you. So. Much.
