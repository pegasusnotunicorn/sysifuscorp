Welcome to the website and development blog for _Sysifus Corp_!

The blog serves to document the process of creating and selling a board game from scratch. A place to record all of the ups & downs, inner-most secrets, and the blood / sweat / tears that go into creating a tangible product. I will share with you all of the lessons I learned and hopefully help you achieve your own goals.

I'd like to thank you for visiting and welcome you along on our journey. While I'm not 100% sure how it'll turn out, it's bound to be a fun adventure and hopefully we can create something amazing together.

-- _Wonmin Lee, Game Designer_
