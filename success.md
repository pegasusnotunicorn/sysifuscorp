### Thanks so much for your order.

We have received your order and will ship your game to you within 3-5 business days.

You will receive via email the details about your purchase soon. If you do not receive anything within the hour, please [let us know](/contact) and we will help sort out the issue.

{% include image.html img-details=page.lou_qc %}

We are not a giant corporation. We are just a [one man team](/about) who is handling literally everything. So there may be some delay in responding to your inquiries or problemsâ€”especially if it's in the middle of the night in NYC.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. And thank you for supporting indie developers. You rock.

-- Wonmin (game designer)
